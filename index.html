         <font color="#FF0000"> <h2>  According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, Israel has dropped more than 25,000 tonnes of explosives on the Gaza Strip since October 7, equivalent to two nuclear bombs.<br>
            
            In comparison, the Little Boy nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima during World War II yielded 15,000 tonnes of high explosives and destroyed everything within a one-mile (1.6km) radius.
            
            The graphic below compares the cumulative explosive power of Israel’s bombs dropped on Gaza to other powerful explosions.</h2>
